# Django-project
This is a demo project of a web server running Django and contains fragments of my entire Django project.

The server serves as a scientific data managing and analyzing platform supporting a team of an academic research institut.

The gratest part of the code is written in Python 3.4 using several packages, object oriented and functional approach following the MVT (MVC) pattern. In addition JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Apache2, mod_wsgi, Debian, Metabase are used. The server is under development but basic functions such as user friendly data entry and data query platforms are already used by our team. The next step is developing an interactive user friendly web-based GUI for the database analyzing the dataset with Data Mining and Machine Learning methods.
